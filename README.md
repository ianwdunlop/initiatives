# Initiatives
In the life sciences there are many dozens of thought leaders actively working to improve the identifiers landscape; however, it is difficult to keep up with enough to know where the overlap/complementarity lies. Not everyone can attend every meeting or every working group, nor should they need to.

The purpose of this repo is limited to gathering information for consumption by a technical audience. That is admittedly narrow, but existing organizations doing the actual work / work products are better suited to hosting it. Specifically, this repo aims to house the following information:

#### 1) What are the (active) working groups addressing identifiers
#### 2) Who is participating in them
#### 3) What they're doing that is of cross-cutting relevance for the identifier landscape
  - tooling
  - publications
  - other standards / guidance
  - meetings/hackathons
  - surveys
  - use cases
  - identification of gaps in knowledge, tooling, etc

#### 4) Known adoption/demonstration of the above products
#### 5) Important updates about products of past identifier efforts, lessons learned etc. Eg. PURL
#### 6) Background reading on past efforts (There is a long history of attempts to improve identifiers, some successful, and some less so)

The "initiatives" github repo is one of the simplest approaches that could possibly work for this information-gathering purpose and allows for "drive-by" contributions by anyone, with additional sanity features of user-driven notification settings, @mentions etc, issue tracker etc. It avoids heavyweight and boring database management for what is a simple problem. The content of this repo is primarily meant for human consumption by technical members of the groups doing the work. The organization "identifiers" is deliberately generic in order to foster broad participation. If we find that we gather so much information that it is overwhelming for even this audience of identifier devotees, we could later explore some ways of summarizing it more meaningfully. To be useful, this repo's content should remain high level, with pointers elsewhere for details.
