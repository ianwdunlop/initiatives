# Initiatives
In the life sciences there are dozens of identifier working groups actively working to improve the landscape; however, there is considerable overlap and complementarity that is difficult to keep up with. Moreover, there is a long history of attempts to improve identifiers, some successful, and some not. Background reading on those efforts is also important to capture.

The purpose of this repo is limited to gathering information for human consumption. That is admittedly narrow, but existing organizations doing the actual work / work products are better suited to hosting it. Specifically, this repo aims to house the following information:

#### 1) What are the (active) working groups addressing identifiers
#### 2) Who is participating in them
#### 3) What they're doing that is of cross-cutting relevance for the identifier landscape
  - tooling
  - documentation
  - publications
  - standards
  - meetings/hackathons
  - surveys
  - use cases
  - identification of gaps in knowledge, tooling, etc

#### 4) Known adoption/demonstration of the above products
#### 5) Products of past identifier efforts, lessons learned etc.

The github repo is one of the simplest approaches that could possibly work for this information-gathering purpose and allows for drive-by contributions by anyone, user-driven notification settings, @mentions etc, issue tracker etc. It avoids heavyweight and boring database management for what is a simple problem. The content of this repo is primarily meant for human consumption by members of the groups doing the work. The organization "identifiers" is deliberately generic in order to foster broad participation. This may lead to summaries of the various contributions of content (eg. papers, blogs, year in review); this can be explored but is not required in order for this content to be useful.
