# Initiatives
In the life sciences there are many dozens of thought leaders actively working to improve the identifiers landscape; however, it is difficult to keep up with enough to know where the overlap/complementarity lies. Not everyone can attend every meeting or every working group, nor should they need to. Let's face it; if you're an identifier geek, you probably became one out of sheer frustration with not being able to do something a lot more interesting -- like data integration. Although we can't magically stop duplication of identifier efforts, we can improve how we disseminate our collective knowledge even if that knowledge isn't consistent. All reasonable contributions of new content are welcome, provided it is done by someone who has at least skimmed the existing content.

The purpose of this repo is limited to gathering information for consumption by a technical audience. That is admittedly narrow, but existing organizations doing the actual work / work products are better suited to hosting it. Specifically, this repo aims to house the following information:

#### 1) What are the (active) working groups trying to improve identifiers for the web
#### 2) Who is participating in them
#### 3) What they're doing that is of cross-cutting relevance for the web-identifier landscape
  - tooling
  - publications
  - other standards / guidance
  - meetings/hackathons
  - surveys
  - use cases
  - identification of gaps in knowledge, tooling, etc

#### 4) Known adoption/demonstration of the above products
#### 5) Important updates about products of past identifier efforts, lessons learned etc. Eg. PURL
#### 6) Background reading on past efforts (There is a long history of attempts to improve identifiers, some successful, and some less so)

If a single source of the above information already exists somewhere, that would be welcome news indeed! If you know of such an effort, click the "edit" button on this file to let us know of its whereabouts; we can then retire this repo. Otherwise, let's just get it done.

The "identifiers/initiatives" github repo is one of the simplest approaches that could possibly work for this information-gathering purpose for the following reasons:
  - 1) "drive-by" contributions by anyone withoug even leaving the browser
  - 2) permissioning / authentication provided free by GitHub
  - 2) user-driven notification settings that integrate with your email
  - 3) @mentions of specific team members
  - 4) issue tracker

It avoids heavyweight and boring database management for what is a simple problem. The content of this repo is primarily meant for human consumption by technical members of the groups doing the work. The organization "githumb.com/identifiers" is deliberately generic in order to foster broad participation. If we find that we gather so much information that it overwhelms even the identifier devotees, we could later explore some ways of summarizing it, or structuring it more meaningfully. To be useful, this repo's content should remain high level, with pointers elsewhere for details.
