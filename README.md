# initiatives
In the life sciences there are dozens of identifier working groups actively working to improve the landscape; however, there is considerable overlap and complementarity that is difficult to keep up with.

The narrow purpose of this repo is documentation: 
1) What those groups are
2) Who is participating in them
3) What they're doing that is of cross-cutting relevance for the identifier landscape
    tooling
    documentation
    publications
    standards
    meetings
    surveys
    use cases
4) When 
    the above documentation should include information about time horizons

The github repo is one of the simplest approaches that could possibly work for this information-gathering purpose and allows for drive-by contributions by anyone, notification settings, @mentions etc, issues etc. It avoids heavyweight and boring database management for what is a simple problem. The content of this repo is primarily meant for human consumption by members of the groups doing the work. Efforts to summarize the various contributions of content can be explored.
